MooTools HTMLX
--------------

This repository is for MooTools *contributors* that are not afraid to make new things.
All users should download MooTools HTMLX from MooTools.net, but since it isn't offered
there yet, you'll have to get it here - we know, that blows.

See the documentation files included in this repo. We don't have anything on the
MooTools Wiki for you, because they rest of the group says HTMLX isn't *official* yet.

The goal is to provide **all browsers** with the power of HTML5, 6, 7, ... X. This means support for:

* Canvas
* Drag & Drop
* Messaging
* Web Workers
* Web Sockets
* ...
* CSS3 Transforms

Mission

* Fill in the gaps between browser support (similar to how MooTools Core does this with JS 1.6+)
* Provide better interfaces for standards ([ART](http://github.com/kamicane/art) API instead of Canvas API)

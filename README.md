MooTools HTMLX
--------------

To provide **all browsers** with the power of HTML5, 6, 7, ... X. This means support for:

* Canvas
* Drag & Drop
* Messaging
* Web Workers
* Web Sockets
* ...
* CSS3 Transforms

Mission
=======

* Fill in the gaps between browser support (similar to how MooTools Core does this with JS 1.6+)
* Provide better interfaces for standards ([ART](http://github.com/kamicane/art) API instead of Canvas API)
